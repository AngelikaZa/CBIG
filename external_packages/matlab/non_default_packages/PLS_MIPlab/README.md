# Behaviour Partial Least Squares (PLS) for Neuroimaging

The main function is `myPLS_analysis.m`, which will run the following steps:

## PLS steps
- Data normalization
- Cross-covariance matrix
- Singular value decomposition
- Brain & behavior scores
- Brain & behavior loadings 
- Permutation testing for components' significance

## Requirements

Requires SPM8/12 for loading & reading volumes, and for visualisation (@slover functions).


## Credits

Code written by Dimitri Van De Ville, Daniela ZÃ¶ller, Valeria Kebets and Thomas AW Bolton, with subfunctions borrowed from the PLS toolbox by Rotman Baycrest (https://www.rotman-baycrest.on.ca/index.php?section=84).
