This project mainly replicates Figure 4 and Figure 7 of Liegeois et al. (2017). 

To see examples of this project, run `CBIG_RL2017_Figure4_toy_ex_HMM.m` and `CBIG_RL2017_Figure7_toy_ex_bi_vs_multi.m`. 
You should get similar results as in Liegeois et al. (2017).

The surrogate data will be generated automatically when you run `CBIG_RL2017_Figure4_toy_ex_HMM.m` and `CBIG_RL2017_Figure7_toy_ex_bi_vs_multi.m`. Hence no further example data or script is needed.
