This project mainly replicates Figure 4 and Figure 7 of Liegeois et al. (2017). 

Run `CBIG_RL2017_Figure4_toy_ex_HMM.m` and `CBIG_RL2017_Figure7_toy_ex_bi_vs_multi.m` to see if you can get similar results as in Liegeois et al. (2017).

The surrogate data will be generated automatically when you run `CBIG_RL2017_Figure4_toy_ex_HMM.m` and `CBIG_RL2017_Figure7_toy_ex_bi_vs_multi.m`. Hence no further unit test data or script is needed.
