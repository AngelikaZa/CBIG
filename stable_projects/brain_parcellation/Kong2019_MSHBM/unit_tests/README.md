# Unit test of Multi-session hierarchical Bayesian model (MS-HBM)

The unit test of MSHBM will run examples provided in the `examples` folder.

The unit test will:

+ Estimate group priors for the 2 example subjects using 2 sessions, the estimation will end at 5th iteration to save computational time.

+ Estimate individual-specific parcellations for example subject 1 using 2 sessions.  
   
See README.md under `examples` folder for more details. Notice that the unit test is **for CBIG lab only**.
